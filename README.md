# LaDfa2Dot

This is a tool to support the development of [parol](https://github.com/jsinger67/parol.git).

It creates Graphviz representations of `parol`'s lookahead DFAs. Parsers generated by `parol` use
them during parsing to decide which production to choose next when facing a certain sequence of
input tokens.

The syntax is derived from the generated parser source (Rust). The tool transforms a generated
parser file into DOT files which are put into the given output folder.

It also inserts the correct terminal name in lieu of the rather cryptic terminal index into the
generated DOT files to increase readability.

This way changes in the resulting DFA could be evaluated much easier.

Try

```shell
cargo run -- --help
```

to get help.


To visualize the lookahead DFAs of the LL(5) grammar used by this crate call this

```shell
cargo run -- -f .\src\la_dfa_2_dot_parser.rs -o ..\la_dfa_2_dot_dot
```

Please note, that the invocation above will create a folder in parallel to the current crate's
folder. This folder will contain the dot files derived resp. re-engineered form the parser used in
this crate.

Inspect for instance the file `ConstDeclaration.dot` which is a good example of a LL(5) lookahead
DFA.
